LOL I learnt how to use the Spotify API, how to use access tokens, authentications via Strava app

- Got an idea to showcase Strava stats, which then led me to [this website](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/)
- Strava's documentation was much clearer and had pictures to illustrate how to do certain things
